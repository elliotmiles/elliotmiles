# About me
I am an aspiring robotics engineer specialising in computer vision and deep learning. I am especially passionate about automation.

## [SLAM vehicle](https://github.com/elliotmiles/jetson-slam-vehicle)
I am currently developing a SLAM vehicle featuring:
- A Jetson Orin Nano
- LiDAR sensing
- Sensor fusion
- Custom powerboard/PCB design

## Robot Arm - [Original](https://github.com/elliotmiles/yolo-robot-arm) | [ROS2 version](https://github.com/elliotmiles/yolo-robot-arm-ros2)
My robot arm project features:
- 4 degrees of freedom
- Homing switches
- Inverse kinematics & coordinate transform
- Stepper motor control with arduino
- I2C control of a vacuum suction cup pump
- Real-time object tracking with a webcam using openCV
- Custom deep learning datasets using PyTorch

The goal of the project is to sort mixed up items. I plan to experiment with different types of end effector to achieve the best grip, and optimising the AI model.
