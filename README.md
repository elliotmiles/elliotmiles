# About me
I am an aspiring robotics engineer specialising in computer vision and deep learning. I am especially passionate about automation.

## Robotic Arm
I am currently working on a robotic arm I'm designing and programming from scratch, featuring:
- 4 degrees of freedom
- homing switches
- inverse kinematics & coordinate transform
- stepper motor control with arduino
- I2C control of a vacuum suction cup pump
- real-time object tracking with a webcam using openCV
- custom deep learning datasets using PyTorch

The goal of the project is to sort mixed up items. I plan to experiment with different types of end effector to achieve the best grip, and optimising the AI model.
